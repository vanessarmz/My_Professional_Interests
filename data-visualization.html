        <p>A process of presenting data as pictures and graphics is known as data visualization, and it can be used in any report or presentation that can benefit the organization. When presenting information to individuals who are not familiar with the meanings, contexts, or consequences of the material being presented, graphic forms are frequently beneficial. They can also aid in the data handlers' ability to recognize hidden patterns or trends. Converting intricate information into a visually appealing manner facilitates managers, executives, and other decision-makers in comprehending and understanding knowledge that can lead their company forward. Job types include Data visualization, business analyst, and data scientist. Some of the technical skills in data visualization are being able to analyze data and have the technical abilities to be able to show these numbers in visual texts.
