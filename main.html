        <h1>Welcome to My Professional Interests</h1>
        <p> Throughout my educational career, I have done research in what my career path will look like. I had also had an interest in certain technologies like programming and graphic design. With the space of my major in IS, I chose cloud computing, data storage management and data visualization. cloud computing, which lets professionals customize infrastructure to meet the needs of their businesses. data storage management poses interesting difficulties for efficiently handling massive amounts of data while upholding compliance, security, and accessibility. On the other hand, data visualization provides a visually appealing means of understanding big, complicated datasets, which helps with decision-making and enhances understanding. The combination of these factors creates an exciting environment that presents opportunities for individuals with an interest in the interaction of technology, data, and creativity to further my career with Information Systems.  </p>
